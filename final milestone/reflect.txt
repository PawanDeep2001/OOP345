Milestones 1 and 2 were pretty quick, but I encountered some difficulties in getting the correct output, especially when I had to
iterate all the workstations, the run function initially gave multiple issues, first of all, I wasn't getting the first iteration
empty, but that was easily sorted. The main issue was then getting all the workstations that were not possible to fill, my code 
initially was made for all the stations that were getting filled, but not those who weren't I had to change the logic in a few functions
even a little bit of login in the workstation.cpp in order to get the output correct. So the coding itself wasn't difficult in this
milestone 3 either, but getting the correct output was the tricky part. The instructions for the run function of the LineManager 
module were not detailed, so it took a while to understand.
Overall it was interesting and gave us a different perspective, then what workshops give us. The modules were interconnected and 
sometimes it took time to understand where to find the error.
