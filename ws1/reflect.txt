The second workshop was mainly about the move operator and the time that takes to do run all
the functions, as we can see the move constructor and the move assignment operators were
much faster than the copy constructor and the copy assignment operator.
This workshop wasn't too difficult, I got few difficulties regarding the 1 argument constructor,
that I wasn't getting the correct output, then I found out that I wasn't rewinding the file
in the correct way, so I just closed the file and reopened it in order not to have any issues, 
I would say it worked brilliantly for me. Then another difficulty I encountered in the starting
was where to place the structure, before I was placing it outside the class, then I found out
that was much easier to place it inside the class.
